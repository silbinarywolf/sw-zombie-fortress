# Zombie Fortress Classic
*Version:* Pre-alpha v0.1.0

This VScript mod aims to be a faithful reimplementation of the Zombie Fortress mode made originally with SourceMod for Team Fortress 2.

## Install

*Warning:* These instructions assume you have no other vscripts setup and will override your `mapspawn.nut` file if you made one.

- Download the latest release:

- For Dedicated servers:
    - Go to your `steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2 Dedicated Server\tf` folder

- For Hosting in-game:
    - Go to your `steamapps\common\Team Fortress 2\tf` folder

- Copy-paste the contents of the zip into it.

- Reload the current map and you'll be playing the Zombie Fortress game mode.
